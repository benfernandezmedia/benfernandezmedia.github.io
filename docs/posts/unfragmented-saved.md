# Why I Stopped and Saved Unfragmented for Later?

!!! note
    This post talks about a project that is paused, scrapped, or saved. It may not be conflicted with my current and future projects. 

On the previous post that I published, I announced that the blog has new features that were implemented to enhance the blog experience. On the section where I introduced the predefined authors I set in my `.authors.yml` file, I mentioned about my character named **Crystal Ashiro** and the project called *Unfragmented*.

## What is Unfragmented?
***Unfragmented*** is a prototype project, which is considered as a visual novel game, that tells a story with this synopsis:

*After starting to live on Earth a year later, a young female alien suffers a life-threatening condition where her mind is shattering, causing her memories to break apart in a painful way. With the help of her new friends on Earth, it is her mission to travel inside of the mind space to restore her memories to it's original state. While doing that, she also discovers secrets behind her past life, revealing the truth that leads to the events of her mother's mysterious death.*

This is also my first attempt on creating a video game that features an original story that I've written but I only wrote the prologue and chapter 1 for the prototype and it's original concept of creating a story for one of my flagship characters.

## The Original Idea of Unfragmented
If the game was worked on properly with a team, I could have had help and assistance of working on the project and story. But I guess I can describe the original idea of how this concept started.

In 2020, I had an idea to create a story for one of the flagship characters that I had created when I was working on new drawings. Originally, I wanted to create an origin story for Crystal, so the idea went under the development name called "Planet Crystal".

But after numerous attempts of creating a proper story, that went unsuccessful, rendering the whole project to be scrapped. At 2022, while working at my job, I was imagining Crystal in a hospital bed with wires attached around her like she was in a life-threatening condition in a mental way. That idea brought the project back to life with a new concept and the final name which is known as "Unfragmented". 

## Saving the project for later...
Despite of the slow progress, there was one big issue: **I was the only one working on the project alone.**

There was a lot of limitations when working on a project like Unfragmented. From working on the story, to slow experimental programing with the Ren'Py engine, and even thinking of the look and feel of the game, it was a conception disaster when working on the game alone. **It was very hard, complicated and very stressful!**

One time, I received a random friend request from an unknown user, trying to invite to become a so-called "developer" for their platform called "YooBox", which I never heard of. The person claimed that they "followed" my Itch Games profile to be invited to test their platform. So I did some research about this platform and it looked legit, it was a 2d engine. However, I still didn't tolerate the idea of a random person friending me out of nowhere so I blocked and ceased communications with them. **I don't actually use game engines that I never actually heard of.** In all seriousness, I will never develop games on engines that are hard and complicated, just need to stay on the basics like the Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine.

For the result, the tough decision was made by keeping the mentions of the project private to prevent situations like this from happening again. While keeping the project private, there also numerous questions I had from a friend which was very tough and hard to answer like where did the inspiration for Unfragmented came from and how big is the project. We almost had an argument but I actually understand his point of view.

After listening his suggestion, I made the decision to save Unfragmented if I decide to return working on it and focus on small projects to get the idea and learn from it to work on large projects. To my assumption, I think working on Unfragmented was a very big project and I literally have no experience of writing a story and making a game at the same time but at least I tried to work hard.

## Aftermath of saving...
The document for the Story Plot that contains the prologue and chapter 1 is still saved in my files. I decided to keep it locked away so I can come back to it in the distant future. If I make a decision to return working on this very unique idea, I need a team to help me work on it, I can't work on it alone.
