# TerrifiCon: First time at Mohegan Sun....also got a printer!

*By the date of this post being published, TerrifiCon has officially wrapped up for the year!*

TerrifiCon is the second convention of my convention travel list. It also marks the first time I entered in the Mohegan Sun Casino and Resort where the event is taken place! I have to say...**the building is huge!**

Aside from comparing buildings where the event was taken place, I have succeeded with obtaining a 3D printer from Team Pyro[^1], it was not that heavy of a machine but at least my dad will start making 3D prints now which I'm happy for him. Earlier today at home, after overhearing the idea of 3D printing Amira, **that's impossible!** Actually I overheard this from my step-mom, but I <ins>**DID NOT**</ins> had that idea to begin with[^2]. We just got the printer for free but we need to find room to setup the machine itself.

## After the con, exploration of Mohegan Sun...
While packing the stuff up and planning to leave, I decided to go back inside and explore Mohegan Sun itself. As I explore, I learned that the building was themed and home to the Mohegan Tribe (telling by the look and feel of the area and the casino's logo font used everywhere through it's signs and areas). Guess it's a mix of history and entertainment when the whole casino is themed to it's Native American tribe. But when we arrived initialy at the casino, I had some help from Pyro as he sugguested to enter in the Winter parking as it was much closer. But outside of the lot, the line for the convention was LONG!

## A new illustration for the picture frame...
While obtaining the printer, I decided to purchase another illustration from Pyropen. Currently, I have 3 illustrations, only 8 to go! My original idea is swapping out illustrations by month, instead of just buying multiple frames because it cost a lot!

But at least, I'm reusing the frame I currently have! It's a **reduce, reuse, and recycle** thing!

[^1]: **Team Pyro** refers to the artist duo of [Pyropen Art](#) and [Bunny's Resin Art](#)
[^2]: It's impossible for me to 3D print my mascot and other characters as I don't have knowledge of creating 3D models to be printed.
