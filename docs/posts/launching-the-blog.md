# **Launching The Blog**
![Blog](/assets/images/blog_banner.png)

As you saw the link on the Instagram story, it's official that I have opened up a blog site! **No paying for hosting, no hard HTML, CSS, and JS coding, NO BS!** Just a straight up site built with Mkdocs Material and powering the site with GitHub Pages for free! :smile:

## But what's the catch on this site?
With this blog, I will be able to post articles regarding content I publish on Instagram, Cara and on YouTube. Updates for the Afterzone Nova Discord server will also be here as well, but under a different post author. Eventually, updates regarding Unfragmented will appear too (if the project is still being worked, but it's saved for now).

## Is this site frequently active?
Actually no, the site gets updated by every git push I send to the site's repository. Before I actually publish it to the live site, I always review the code, the posts, and everything before flagging it as production. So it takes time and patience.

## So what now, since the blog is here?
For now, while maintaining the site on GitHub, I'm experimenting with the Mkdocs Material code to adjust specific features that will be tuned for the blog. New articles will appear here from time-to-time depending on my blog schedule.
