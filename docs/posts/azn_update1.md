# Server Maintainance Upcoming: August 9th - August 11th

![Afterzone Nova](../assets/images/afterzonenova_logo.png)

Hi, this is Amira from Afterzone Nova, the official Discord of Benjamin Fernandez Media!

As this is my first post on the official blog, departing my duties as the hostess of the **Information Desk** on the server, we have scheduled a server maintainance date for *this weekend.* I know the server might be abandoned at this point but we still have duties to maintain it. **Responsibilities comes first** when handling a Discord server that is barely active.

## What to expect on the target maintainance dates?
Although the channels are barely active except for the `#internews` channel, we might rearrange, delete, or add channels to keep the server environment organized. It will be a lot easier to keep things *simple and clean* (Heh, Kingdom Hearts theme reference!) at all times during your stay in the server.

The roles that you're assigned in the server, it will stay the same! No changes will be added and it won't impact your status. This also includes the bots, they won't be removed but they will be reconfigured eventually.

For prevention of the server's security being breached like members who join in to spam and cause havoc, the invites will be paused for 24 hours, it may vary on how much time we put on in the changes we will be performing.

## What about you as a webhook, Amira?
For me, I will still be around in the server but I will be posting my updates that I written on the blog there, redirecting all members to the blog site where the post is made.

As I mention before, I will be departing my duties of being the hostess of the Information Desk and start my duties as the update guide of Afterzone Nova! *It can be challenging but it's going to be extremely fun!*

Being a hostess of a server newsletter can be very hard, in terms of finding stuff I see in the internet of what's currently trending (posting real-life news and stuff). So instead, as being the update guide, I will start posting updates that is happening around the server and the community itself.

## Will the server guide will be changed too?
**Absolutely!** Since the server guide is outdated, we might add new resources to the server guide for existing and new members of the server. It's the only way to spice things up for a bit!

!!! warning "Things to keep in mind"
    Remember, we might change the server rules depending our current status. To keep things fair and safe for the server community, new rules will be added. If you're currently a member of the server and want to share an invite link for a friend, please ask Benjamin, the server owner, for a limited use invite link.

    For first-time members who are joining, new questions will be added regarding where you found the server and what's your purpose of joining.

We are looking forward for the upcoming dates to improvise the server! So stay tuned for more updates regarding the server, **right here on the blog!**

*- Amira*
